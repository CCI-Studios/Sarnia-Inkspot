				<h1>Welcome to Sarnia Inkspot!</h1>
				<p>	Usually, you would plan out your future.  What if your future chooses you?  
					That is what happened to us, Helene & Varvara Laskaratos, new owners and operators of Sarnia Inkspot.  
					We have just taken over the eco-friendly business of refilling and recycling ink cartridges and toners.  
					We believe that every little step helps in saving the planet.  When you recycle or refill your cartridge or toner, you are helping cut down on non-biodegradable waste in the environment.</p> 
				<p>	Also you can save up to 40% off the cost of purchasing a new cartridge for your printing needs and we offer a 100% guarantee.  
					Sarnia Inkspot offers fast and friendly service to people in Sarnia and surrounding areas.</p>
				<p>	As we become more familiar with the products and demands, there is the possibility of broadening our services to better accommodate our customers' needs.  Being a family owned and operated business, you'll get the personal touch that you wouldn't get at a Big Box Store.</p> 
					Come on down to 151 Davis St. in Sarnia and see what we're all about!  
				<p>	Hours are Monday to Friday 9-5.</p> 
				<p> We can be reached by phone or fax at (519) 344-6219 and by e-mail at sarniainkspot@hotmail.ca</p>
				<p>	We service </p>
				<p>	Lexmark, Brother, Canon, HP, Epson, Dell, Xerox, Kodak.</p>
				<p> Also we sell remanufactured toner cartridges and we only accept cash.</p>
